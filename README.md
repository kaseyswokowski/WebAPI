# React-CRUD-with-Asp.Net-Core-Web-API #

React js CRUD Operations- Insert, Update, Delete and Retrieve are implemented with Asp.Net Core Web API from Scratch.<br>

First of all, I built a Web API in Asp.Net Core with SQL Server and Entity Framework. Defined DB Model with EF Code First Approach then
created Asp.Net Controller with web methods for CRUD Operations.<br>

Created React App with create-react-app package. A Form is designed using Material-UI.
Implemented Validation per control as well as whole form. Web API is consumed during Form Submission and Retrieved
existing records once the app is rendered. For State Management I used Redux. Unlike previous react projects here I
created React component with React Hooks.


Features: <br>
* Build Web API in Asp.Net Core with CRUD web methods<br>
* React Form Design with Material UI<br>
* Implemented CRUD with Redux<br>
* Enabled CORS in Web API<br>
* Consume API web methods from React<br>
* Real-Time Form Validation<br>
